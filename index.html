         <h2>What is this?</h2>
         <p>I think it is pretty clear that our political system is broken (by our I mean the USA). Everyday, I see the real citizens lament the corrupt direction the "leadership" of our "democracy" is trying to take the county. But alas, there is so much corruption and power involved, noone has much of a clue what to do. The citizens aren't represented: event when we elect a supposedly populist candidate, we get a corporatist asshole. The system doesn't work.</p>

         <p> If the system doesn't work, what else do we do? Some people understandably suggest riots. We had a peaceful attempt earlier with Occupy Wall Street. Neither of these were good solutions. Riots for obvious reasons. And even if successful, the power vacuum wouldn't be a good idea: who knows what kind of system we would get out of it. Any form of disobedience can be weathered by the power structure, and too many people are too impoverished to handle the hit to their wealth disobedience would cost. Wage slaves are easy to control.</p>

         <p>Why didn't Barak Obama work? I'm not sure. Part of the reason, I think, is that he is too entrenched in the political-media-corporate complex . I include the media here for a very specific reason. Their systems are out of date, and our campaigns are largely run by them. They are corporations themselves (mostly) and have their own set of interests. They are big slow machines that try to appeal to people in a way that gets them ads. This means their content will take on a pop-music quality (no offense meant to pop-music) to appeal to as many people as possible. Depth is sacrificed for consumability.</p>

         <p>As a denizen of the internet age, I am not used to being required to eat whatever garbage I am fed. On the internet, conversations can take on whatever depth they need, over whatever timespan necessary. More importantly, conversations can happen, not vegetation. But our political system runs best with vegetables: people are expected to tune in and listen, pick a side that they like the most, and then drag themselves into a booth to pick their guy. They can very well "debate" amongst themselves about which guy is better, but at they end of the day their choices are already decided. The inbred goverment feeds off the mega-corporations' discharge, and writes laws that sustain the inbreeding to maintain the status quo.</p>

         <p>In order to escape the thinly veiled feudalism, I believe we need a new system. As a pragmatist, I don't think a new system is entirely possible right now. But as a technologist, I believe their may be a simple hack around that problem.</p>

         <h2>Get to the point</h2>
         <h3>The big picture</h3>
         <p>We can have a fake election. This way, it requires no consent from the status quo. This may seem stupid, but all power is really fake. Without organization, we just go with it.</p>

         <p>How does that help, you might ask. Well, not just any election, but an election designed democratically, leveraging the capabilities of the 21st century. Hopefully, if the system can effectively source and filter candidates well enough, we can feed our own winners into the "real" election. Running in our system should be enough of a endorsement that we can collectively engage to vote them in in the real ones. And honestly, how hard can it be to improve on the shit we have now?</p>
         <h3>How it could work</h3>
         <p>I am not going to expand on all the details right now (laziness), but there are three main components.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Candidates should answer to the will of the people. The first phase of the election should be a list of topics. The voters in the system should be able to propose, vote, and discuss what is important to them. This could be a reddit-like list of topics that get ordered by voters over time.</li>

            <li>The next phase should be the debates. These can be kind of similar to reddit as well, but instead with randomly grouped sets of candidates that are told to talk about some of the topics. I believe a free form system would be optimal to allow candidates to self-differentiate. Voter comments should be here as well. There should be a number of rounds of debate, which should each take quite a long time (weeks?). Candidates should have profiles that don't require their real identity until late in the system.</li>

            <li>There will need to be a system to verify all users as US citizens. This is really the hardest part (as far as I am aware). One solution is to validate their address and send a post card to them, which they are required to send back. Vote power could be tweaked for too many duplicates at a single address, with some extra validation to get back to full.</li>
         </ol>
         <h2>Some nuts and bolts</h2>
         <p>I don't want to own this. Any help, in any form, is appreciated. If you have suggestions, comments on the feasibility of the idea, frothy insults, or anything else, you can direct them to representation.io@gmail.com</p>
         <p>If you are technical, you can fork the repo I am going to create at https://github.com/representation and help contribute. I am planning on using Go to do most of this, but you can do whatever you want. You can suggest changes to this page as well.</p>
